## About Laravel Pusher Notification

This is my first time project here. The project is working. All you have to do is create ".env" file and apply PUSHER informations.

## .ENV and Pusher Variables

BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher // Please, try to remove any existing instance of that. Just one must exist!
PUSHER_APP_ID=###### // Replace with your ID with Pusher
PUSHER_APP_KEY=##### // Replace with your APP_KEY with Pusher
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=## // Replace with your APP_SECRET with Pusher
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=# // Replace with your APP_CLUSTER with Pusher
